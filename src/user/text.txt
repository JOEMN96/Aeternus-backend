Fundraising Proposal for Bhagat Singh Library's Transformation

Bhagat Singh Library, Nadutheri: Community Revitalization Proposal

Introduction
Forty years ago, the Bhagat Singh Library began in a humble shack, founded by four dedicated local residents. Over the decades, what started with just an 
idea has grown into a beloved community landmark. Today the library is especially cherished for its annual December cultural-literary festival, 
which draws families and neighbours together in celebration. However, even as the library is a symbol of our heritage, it is rarely used for the rest 
of the year. If fully supported and modernised, Bhagat Singh Library can inspire residents of all ages to learn and grow year-round.

Community Engagement & Current Challenges
Despite its promising origins, Bhagat Singh Library’s use beyond the December festival has been limited. For most of the year,
the building sits quietly empty and its newspaper and facilities see almost no traffic. The old structure has suffered – the roof leaks during rains,
water drips inside and damages materials. Without intervention now, the library may not even survive to celebrate its 50th anniversary. 
We face an urgent need to rebuild and revitalise the library so that it serves Nadutheri far into the future. 

A rebuilt, weatherproof building would be that environment – with parents bringing children to read, students to study or do homework, 
and even seniors spending afternoons reading newspapers under a sturdy roof. By ensuring these conditions, our library will truly serve the 
community every day, not just in December.

Transformation Plan
To secure the library’s future, we propose a comprehensive rebuilding plan. The new library will be a modern two-storey facility on the same site, 
designed to accommodate both quiet study and lively learning. 

Key elements of this plan include:
Two-Floor Layout: Ground floor dedicated to a quiet reading room and newspaper lounge; second floor for book shelves and lending services. 
This separation allows families to read newspapers downstairs while children or researchers browse books upstairs.
Furnishings: Sturdy shelves, tables, chairs, and good lighting throughout. The ground floor will feature benches and comfortable seating, 
while the upper floor will have organised book stacks and a front desk.

Digital Access: A computer workstation with internet and free Wi-Fi (Powered by solar panels). This corner will enable students to do online research and 
residents to fill out government forms or take online courses.

Community E-Service Kiosk: Using the computer and internet, the library can assist locals with e-governance services (passport applications, 
Aadhaar updates, certificates, etc.). Trained volunteers could guide people through official websites, effectively making the library an e-Seva centre.

This vision will make Bhagat Singh Library a vibrant year-round community centre, not just a venue for an annual event. 
Equipped with quiet study areas and technology, it can help bridge the digital divide and empower people of all ages. 
As one community library leader puts it, the goal is to make accessing books as easy as playing with a phone – “free to use, open to all”.

Key Milestones
Over the past forty years, Bhagat Singh Library has achieved many milestones:
1985 – Founding: The library was established by four Nadutheri residents in a small roadside shack, starting with just a few dozen books.
1992 – Relocation: As membership grew, the library moved into a larger structure. Community volunteers contributed funds and labour to improve the space.
2000 – First Literary Day: The inaugural December “Literary Day” was held, featuring speeches, storytelling, and games. It became a beloved tradition drawing over 200 villagers each year.
2008 – Collection Expansion: The library added 500 new books (through donations and purchases), including children’s storybooks and reference volumes. A volunteer librarian and cataloguing system were established.
2015 – Digital Debut: A donated desktop computer and printer were introduced, providing villagers with basic internet access. Some local students began using it for research and exam preparation.
2025 – 40th Anniversary: The community celebrated four decades of learning. This milestone reaffirmed our commitment to the library’s future and inspired plans for a major upgrade.
These achievements show how community support has driven growth. Each improvement drew more people in – a trend we aim to continue with the proposed transformation.

Budget Estimate
An estimated budget for rebuilding and equipping the library is as follows:
Building (2 floors): Rs. 5,00,000 - Rs. 8,00,000 – covers construction of the new structure (about 200 sq. ft.) including foundation, walls, floors, and roof.
Interior Furnishings: Rs. 1,00,000 – shelving units, reading tables, chairs, fans, and lighting fixtures.
Solar Power System: Rs. 1,20,000 – approximately for a 2 kW solar panel setup with inverter and battery
Computer & Connectivity: Rs. 50,000 – desktop computer, printer/scanner, Wi-Fi router, and initial internet installation.
Books & Resources: Rs. 50,000 – new books, magazines, and educational materials.

These figures are estimates; actual costs may vary. We plan to raise the necessary funds through donations from individuals, 
local businesses, diaspora supporters, and relevant grant programmes.

Call to Action:
Now is the moment for Nadutheri to come together and realise this vision. The Bhagat Singh Library is more than a building — it is a cradle of knowledge
and a catalyst for community development. With your support, we can transform it into a vibrant, modern hub. Imagine children reading newspapers in new 
light-filled rooms; students learning on the computer; families accessing government services in their own village. We invite community leaders, 
local businesses, and generous donors to join this effort. Any contribution, big or small, will make a difference. Whether through funding, labour, 
or advocacy, your involvement is crucial.

By investing in Bhagat Singh Library today, you help ensure it stays open and relevant for generations to come. Together, let us build this future — 
a modern, community-powered library that honours our past and enlightens Nadutheri’s future.

Bhagat Singh Library, Nadutheri: Community Revitalization Proposal
Introduction
Nearly 40 years ago, the Bhagat Singh Library was founded in a modest shack by four visionary individuals who believed in the power of collective learning. Over the years, this humble beginning evolved into a cherished community landmark, especially known for its vibrant December cultural-literary festival—a time when families gather, stories are shared, and community spirit is rekindled.

However, for the rest of the year, the library remains largely underutilized. With only newspapers available, the space currently serves mostly the elderly who come to catch up on daily news. There are no books to borrow, no digital tools to access, and no programs to engage the younger generation.

While we honour this important role the library has played in the lives of elders, we believe now is the time to take a new step—to transform the library into a modern space that serves all ages, while still embracing its original purpose.

Community Engagement & Current Challenges
Bhagat Singh Library holds a special place in our village’s collective memory, yet today it faces a quiet crisis. Beyond December’s celebration, activity is minimal. The current building is aging—its roof leaks during monsoons, walls are deteriorating, and infrastructure is no longer safe or inviting.

Without action, the library’s future is uncertain. It may not even stand to witness its 50th anniversary. We must act now, not just to preserve a building, but to reimagine its potential as a space that educates, empowers, and evolves with the needs of Nadutheri.

We envision a new library where:

Elders can continue to read newspapers in comfort and dignity.

Children can explore stories that spark imagination.

Youth can access books, the internet, and government services.

The community gathers not only in celebration but also in learning, support, and growth.

Transformation Plan
We propose to rebuild and expand the Bhagat Singh Library into a two-storey, multi-purpose facility that honours its legacy while enabling future-ready services.

Key Elements of the Plan:
Two-Floor Layout:

Ground Floor: A peaceful space for reading newspapers, especially designed for our senior readers.

First Floor: A lending library with books for all ages, along with a digital corner featuring a computer and Wi-Fi.

Furnishings:
Sturdy bookshelves, comfortable chairs, tables and lights, a welcoming space for all.

Digital Access:
A computer with internet connectivity, enabling students to do research, villagers to complete online forms, and youth to gain digital literacy not just online games. Power will be supported by solar panels.

Community E-Service Corner:
The digital station can also serve as a basic e-Seva center—helping locals with tasks such as applying for passports, Aadhaar updates, government certificates, and more.

This is not just a library. It is a transformation from a reading room to a knowledge hub, a place where tradition meets technology, where every villager finds something of value.

Key Milestones
Over four decades, the Bhagat Singh Library has served Nadutheri with dedication:

1985 – Founding: Initiated by four residents in a roadside shack.

1992 – Relocation: Moved into a more stable building with local support.

2025 – 40th Year: A call for transformation—where we stand today.

Budget Estimate
We present a practical, community-driven budget for this transformation:

Item	Estimated Cost (INR)
Building (2 floors, ~200 sq.ft)	₹5,00,000 – ₹8,00,000
Interior Furnishings	₹1,00,000
Solar Power Setup (2 kW)	₹1,20,000
Computer & Internet Setup	₹50,000
Books & Resources	₹50,000
Total Estimate	₹8,20,000 – ₹10,20,000

Planning to collect ₹10,00,000 if we cant reach this milestone, we are planning to do,
    ₹2,00,000 - new concrete roof and second floor is coverd with metal beams and sheet.
    ₹5,00,000 - New One storey building
    ₹10,00,000 - Two storey building.

Note: These are approximate figures. Detailed quotations will follow based on funding availability and contractor engagement.

Funds will be raised through individual contributions, local businesses, village-based self-help groups, and our diaspora network.

The time to act is now.

We invite every resident of Nadutheri, every well-wisher, and every changemaker to support this transformation. Your support can be financial, material, or voluntary. Every rupee, every book, and every helping hand brings us closer to this Dream of 40 years.
